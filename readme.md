# Accessible Pass prompt.

Sometimes writing passwords can be difficult for several reasons, such as not knowing the keyboard distribution very well, or you are using passwords with unusual symbols.

This add-on provides a custom dialog to enter a password. Every time you need to write something in a text box and for some reason you need an alternative editing field, this add-on will come to the rescue.

Its use is very simple: when you are in a text field, press NVDA + Windows + P, type the password and press Enter. The password will be written in the focused field.

If for some reason the focus is not the same as the focus prior to open the password dialog of this add-on, the password won't be written for security reasons.

Notes:

1. The script to open the dedicated password dialog is categorized as "System focus". So, see that category to change the gesture if needed.
2. If you press the command to open the dedicated dialog and the dialog is already open, it will be closed. This can help if for some reason, you can't find the dialog.
